# Digital Design Projects in Verilog

This repository contains a collection of digital design projects developed in Verilog HDL. These projects were initially written, tested, and simulated on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/), a web-based IDE for hardware design and verification.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Language**: Verilog HDL (IEEE Std 1364-2001)
- **Simulator**: EDA Playground (e.g., Icarus Verilog, Synopsys VCS, etc.)
- **Waveform Viewer**: GTKWave (where applicable)

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains the following:
- Verilog source files (`.v`)
- Testbenches for functional verification
- Simulation files, etc.

## 📋 List of Digital Designs

Below are the Verilog modules currently available in this repository:

- [ ] `All logic gates including NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR`
- [ ] `Combinational Circuits including Half Adder, Full Adder, Multiplexers, Encoder, Decoder, Binary to Gray Conv, Gray to Binary Conv`
- [ ] `Sequential Circuits including Flip Flops (SR, JK, D, T), Synchronizer, etc`
- [ ] `Modelling Styles`, .
- [ ] `16x8 Dual Port RAM (Single Clock+Testcases, Two Clock, and with Self-Checking Testbench)`, etc.
- [ ] `8x8 Synchronous FIFO Design (With testcases and self-checking testbench)`, etc.
- [ ] `110100 Sequence Detector FSM Design`, etc.
- [ ] `More coming soon...`

> ✨ Feel free to contribute by improving the designs, adding testbenches, or suggesting new modules.

## How to Run this Projects?

- Just open [EDA playground](https://edaplayground.com/), write or copy-paste these verilog+testbench codes on EDA, and simulate it.
