# Digital Design Projects in Verilog

This repository contains a collection of digital design projects developed in Verilog HDL. These projects were initially written, tested, and simulated on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/), a web-based IDE for hardware design and verification.

## üîß Tools Used

- **Language**: Verilog HDL (IEEE Std 1364-2001)
- **Simulator**: EDA Playground (e.g., Icarus Verilog, Synopsys VCS, etc.)
- **Waveform Viewer**: GTKWave (where applicable)

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each folder contains the following:
- Verilog source files (`.v`)
- Testbenches for functional verification
- Simulation logs (optional)
- Screenshots or waveform outputs (if available)

## üìã List of Digital Designs

Below are the Verilog modules currently available in this repository:

- [ ] `<Design Name 1>`
- [ ] `<Design Name 2>`
- [ ] `<Design Name 3>`
- [ ] `<Design Name 4>`
- [ ] *(Add more as needed)*

> ‚ú® Feel free to contribute by improving the designs, adding testbenches, or suggesting new modules.

## How to Run this Projects?

- Just open EDA playground, write or copy-paste these verilog+testbench codes on EDA, and simulate it.
